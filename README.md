# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns and relationships.  
The main goal is to analyze the dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations to identify trends, anomalies, and correlations among the features.  

EDA is an essential step in the data science workflow as it helps in:
- Understanding the dataset structure  
- Detecting missing or inconsistent data  
- Identifying important relationships between variables  
- Preparing the data for further modeling or analysis

Tools & Libraries
The project uses the following tools and libraries:  
- **Python** – Programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data handling, cleaning, and statistical summaries  
- **Matplotlib** – Basic data visualizations  
- **Seaborn** – Advanced statistical plots  
- **Plotly Express** – Interactive and dynamic visualizations

📝 Work Done
The EDA workflow in `task2_eda.py` covers the following steps:

1. **Data Overview**
   - Loading the dataset  
   - Checking column names, data types, and missing values  
   - Generating basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)  

2. **Visualizations**
   - **Histograms** – for distribution of numeric features  
   - **Boxplots** – for detecting outliers  
   - **Correlation Matrix** – to find relationships between numeric features  
   - **Pairplots** – to visualize pairwise relationships  
   - **Interactive Scatter Plots (Plotly)** – for exploring trends interactively  

3. **Feature-Level Inferences**
   - Summary of each numeric feature including mean, median, and standard deviation  
   - Observations based on visualizations, such as patterns, trends, and anomalies

## 📊 Sample Outputs
- Histograms and Boxplots for numeric feature distribution  
- Correlation heatmap for feature relationships  
- Pairplots to identify trends between pairs of features  
- Interactive scatter plots for detailed exploration
