# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Crocodile Dataset

##  Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a comprehensive dataset of crocodile observations.  
The dataset contains information about various species of crocodiles, including their physical characteristics, geographic location, age, sex, habitat, and conservation status.  

The main goal of this project is to:
- Understand the dataset structure and characteristics  
- Identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data  
- Generate visual insights using statistical plots and interactive charts

## üìù Work Done
The EDA workflow includes:

1. **Data Overview**
   - Load the dataset and inspect basic information  
   - Check for missing values and data types  
   - Generate summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)  

2. **Visualizations**
   - **Histograms & Boxplots** for numeric features (length, weight)  
   - **Correlation Matrix** to find relationships between numeric features  
   - **Pairplots** to explore feature interactions  
   - **Interactive Scatter Plots (Plotly)** for trend analysis  

3. **Feature-Level Inferences**
   - Identify patterns in length, weight, and age classes  
   - Analyze distribution of species across countries, habitats, and conservation status  
   - Observe any anomalies or outliers

## üìä Key Insights
- Patterns in size and weight distribution across different species  
- Relationship between habitat type and conservation status  
- Geographic distribution of observed species  
- Insights into population trends and potential conservation focus areas
